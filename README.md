## 1. Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to explore and familiarize ourselves with the [NATS](https://nats.io/) messaging system and to conduct a simple case study that demonstrates its key advantages and functionalities. By delving into NATS, we aim to gain insights into its architecture, scalability, reliability, and performance characteristics. Through our case study, we intend to showcase how NATS can facilitate efficient communication between microservices or distributed components within a system, highlighting its suitability for modern, cloud-native environments.
